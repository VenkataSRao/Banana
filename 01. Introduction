Banana project is a fork of Kibana, and works with all kinds of time series and non-time series data stored in Apache Solr.

It uses Kibanaâ€™s powerful dashboard configuration capabilities, ports key panels to work with Solr, and provide significant 
additional capabilities, including new panels that leverage D3.js.

Data can be ingested into Solr through a variety of ways, including LogStash, Flume and other connectors.
