Banana project is a fork of Kibana, and works with all kinds of time series and non-time series data stored in Apache Solr.

It uses Kibana’s powerful dashboard configuration capabilities, ports key panels to work with Solr, and provide significant 
additional capabilities, including new panels that leverage D3.js.

Data can be ingested into Solr through a variety of ways, including LogStash, Flume and other connectors.
